- **Multiple Vendors** - Different support contracts, integration nightmares
- **Training Overhead** - Staff learning 5+ different systems
- **Reporting Chaos** - Pulling data from multiple sources manually
- **Integration Costs** - Expensive middleware and custom development
- **License Proliferation** - Per-user fees across multiple systems
